Archodex modified elftoolchain
==============================

Archodex uses this modified version of elftoolchain
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/elftoolchain/) v0.7.1, the project's
latest release. The modifications allow linking libbpf
(https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf) with libelf from this package
instead of libelf from elfutils (https://sourceware.org/elfutils/):

- Add build support for the Arm64 architecture
- Ensure compatibility with libbpf
    - Remove elf_open(), which is not part of elfutils' libelf and
      conflicts with libbpf's elf_open() function
    - Add stubs for a few gelf
      (https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?gelf(3)) functions
      that are called by libbpf but do not need full implementations
